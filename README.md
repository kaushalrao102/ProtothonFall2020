# ProtothonFall2020
This repository includes contents from my team's submission for Fall 2020's Protothon event, hosted by the Product Buds Community. 

Protothon is a product/design-oriented hackathon where teams have 2 days to work on writing a case in response to a provided prompt. This year, the prompt was: 
"COVID-19 and recent events in 2020 have brought about drastic changes in the way we live. These changes have introduced new challenges and opportunities to address. How can we help people adapt to the new normal? How can we leverage technological innovation to shape the new normal? Conceptualize a product and/or service that will address a trend in the education sector."

Our team decided to conceptualize and design an online platform that public school districts could utilize to facilitate the process of localized mentor-mentee matching. The goal of our product is to tackle the issue of academic student disengagement and absenteeism, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and has disproportionately affected young, low-income minority students. Included in this repository are:

1) The case that my team and I wrote up, which includes 4 pages of information on the problem, targeted user groups, user pain points, our solution, tradeoffs, KPIs, go-to-market / monetization strategy, and future steps for building features and further validation. Following the actual case is the appendices section, which includes information on key statistics & visualizations, market competitors, user personas, user journeys, and design-oriented mockups created in Figma. References are included at the end of the document. 
2) The 15-slide slide deck that consolidates information presented in the case.
